The UI for accounts representing money owed to / from a person has been redesigned to remove clutter and add a few new features. It now shows all transactions since the owed balance was last 0, allows you to enter an email and phone number for a person, and generate reciepts with the option to share via Messages, Mail or any other app which integrates with the iOS share sheet. 

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/tabs/money/people" %}

If Messages or Mail are installed on the device the app will show shortcuts to message or mail using the details entered into the app, however you can use any app which supports sharing. 

> The ability to import contacts will be added into the future
{: .prompt-info }
