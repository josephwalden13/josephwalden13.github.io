Money is an app for iOS which allows users to keep track of transactions,
accounts, budgets and work. There is no planned release date at the moment.

## Transactions

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/tabs/money/transactions" %}

The transactions tab shows a list of transactions in reverse date order and any future transactions and [payments](#payments), e.g. recurring transactions, bills, interest payments and income.

The details page allows you to view and modify details of a transaction, such as its date, name, price, [category](#categories) and [account](#accounts). It also allows you to enter notes, split the transaction into smaller ones, mark the transaction as repeating, and mark the transaction as [lent](#borrowed).

When selecting an account in the details page its balance is changed to reflect the new transaction.

Repeating transactions are created on the due date, copying details from the previous transaction and updating the balance of the account it is linked to.
